**Thaw - Full stack developer | Ruby, Python, React, Meteor**

I am Thaw, a full stack developer with 6+ years Ruby, 1+ year React, 1+ year Python and 3+ years Meteor experience.

I hate doing things repeatedly, that’s why I love programming. And I do believe coding is mainly about the mindset and logic.

I’ve dealt with real online services, specially SaaS applications. With experience of designing and building apps from scratch, I can make my own deploying, testing and benchmarking scripts. So making stable applications as well as configuring load balanced servers could not embarrass me.

I do believe that dealing with real traffic and real online service is much more complicated than building a MVP.

Currently, I'm focusing on Ruby, Python and React, as well as ML and AI.

Remotely working as a full-stack developer is truly my dream.

I created a very simple blog/portfolio application (w/ React & Firebase), please feel free to check it out at: https://thaw.dev
