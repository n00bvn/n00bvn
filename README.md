**Thaw - Senior Software Engineer | Ruby, React, Flutter**

My name is Thaw, and I am a full-stack developer with over 8 years of experience in Ruby, more than 2 years in React, over a year in Python, and 2+ years in Flutter.

I have a passion for programming that ranges from creating sorting algorithms to publishing production applications.

I have extensive experience with real online services, particularly SaaS. This includes designing and building applications from scratch that served over 10,000 clients, managing and monitoring real traffic, and contributing to applications with millions of users. My experiences have equipped me to handle a variety of challenges—from fixing bugs and refactoring features to scaling stable services and configuring multiple servers—without difficulty.

I firmly believe that managing real traffic and online services is significantly more complex than developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Moreover, I hold that coding, a passion of mine, is primarily about mindset and logic.

I advocate for the perspective that software engineers should design software, not merely code it. I am a quick learner, a diligent team member, and a positive individual.

Currently, I'm focusing on Ruby, React & Flutter. I’d like to learn more about ML, AI & Web 3.0 in the future.

While some people dream big, my ultimate dream is to work remotely as a full-stack developer!

I created a very simple blog/portfolio application (w/ React & Firebase), please feel free to check it out at: https://thaw.dev
