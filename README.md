**Thaw - Senior Software Engineer | AI, Ruby, Python, Javascript, Dart**

I'm a passionate software engineer with over 10 years of experience building scalable applications and monitoring production systems. My journey spans from co-founding and scaling a SaaS platform that served 10k+ clients to working with industry leaders like Uber on global car-sharing platforms.

Currently, I'm exploring the frontiers of AI, LLMs, and Agents as a SoloFounder at Pando and Lily, LLC, where I've built real-world AI applications including Paperboy News and Datumize AI. I thrive on solving complex technical challenges and have extensive experience in system design, database optimization, application monitoring, and building robust, production-ready applications.

Coding is my passion â€” I love the problem-solving aspect, the continuous learning, and the satisfaction of building something that makes a real impact. Whether it's optimizing database performance by 30%, managing zero-downtime deployments, or architecting new features from scratch, I approach every project with enthusiasm and attention to detail.
