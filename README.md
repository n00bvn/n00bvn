**Thaw - Full stack developer | Ruby, Python, React, Meteor**

My name is Thaw. I'm currently living in Hanoi city, Vietnam.

I’ve 6+ years Ruby experience, 1+ year React experience, 1 year Python experience and 3+ years Meteor experience.

I hate doing things repeatedly, that’s why I love programming. From using my computer to how I deploy applicaCons or managing servers, I always love writing my own scripts.

I’ve dealt with real online services, specially SaaS applicaCons. With experience of building apps from scratch, I can make my own deploying, testing and benchmarking scripts. I faced high traffic services, so making stable applicaCons as well as configuring load balanced servers could not embarrass me.

Remotely working as a full-stack developer is truly my dream.

I created a very simple blog/portfolio application (ReactJS and Firebase app), please feel free to check it out at: https://n00bvn.github.io/thaw-dev
