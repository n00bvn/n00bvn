**Thaw - Full stack developer | Ruby, Python, React, Flutter**

I am Thaw, a full stack developer with 7+ years Ruby, 2+ years React, 1+ years Python and 1+ years Flutter experience.

I hate doing things repeatedly, that’s why I love programming. And I do believe coding is mainly about the mindset and logic.

I’ve dealt with real online services, specially SaaS applications. With experience of designing and building apps from scratch, I can make my own deploying, testing and benchmarking scripts. So making stable applications as well as configuring load balanced servers could not embarrass me.

I do believe that dealing with real traffic and real online service is much more complicated than building a MVP.

Currently, I'm focusing on Ruby, Python, React & Flutter. I’d like to learn more about ML, AI & Web 3.0 in the future.

Remotely working as a full-stack developer is truly my dream.

I created a very simple blog/portfolio application (w/ React & Firebase), please feel free to check it out at: https://thaw.dev
